MARKET STUDY
 Generally applicable if we are making Pressure Chamber as a product for sales or services.
 Internal demand (market survey) details can be provided. Example, number times Pressure 
Chamber being used for zero-defect policy in Operations and / or maintenance. Highlighting such 
examples can create avenues for value (internal) addition or savings in operation cost as well 
bringing in improvements

Transportation and installation planning method need to be discussed
KT should be done to vendor about transportation and installation process Proper plan can help us to save time in transportation and installation and the process can be completed without delay. Proper roadmap has to be created and need to be validated before the starting of the process PAC/Vendor Health and safety Patent/legal/standards External/Internal Organization Handling of hazardous materials • Conditions under which work activities take place i.e., whether it is conducted indoors or outside • Different locations/workstations where the level of risk varies • Times during the day when the risks may be higher • Direct exposure of workers to risks or high risk-prone equipment • Activities that are hazardous or physically dangerous • Possibilities of people other than workers to be affected by the work activities 4 2 8 High

CHECKSHEET FOR TRANSPORTATION OF MATERIAL TO SITE
INSPECTION ITEMS N/A Corrective Action Corrected at time of inspection Date completed
Job Design When possible, jobs are designed to minimize manual material handling. When possible, mechanical lifting devices (Forklifts, hoists, cranes, and block and tackle) are used. Manual lifting and carrying devices (dollies, hand trucks, pry bars, and hooks) are available and in good condition. Where possible, materials and equipment are used that are easy to lift and carry (for example, bricks with handholds or fiberglass ladders). Where possible, materials are ordered in small, light quantities (for example, 3-foot drywall or small packages of cement). Lifting tasks are divided among workers to reduce repetitive lifting. Heavy materials which must be lifted manually are stored off the ground, no lower than knee height. (This limits the height of the lifting required and reduces pressure on the spine.) Heavy materials are stored where there is enough space to lift them safely, without reaching or twisting. When possible, jobs are designed to minimize manual material handling. Training Workers have been trained about all identified lifting hazards on the job Workers have been trained in safe lifting techniques Work Practices Materials are delivered as close as possible to where they will be used. Loads are split up to reduce weight. Walkways are kept clear to allow use of material handling devices like carts and dollies. Testing done by name with signature Checked by name with signature 29

• Based on the data received from the testing phase 
and it was verified and validated from the PAC 
team.
• Once the received data is based on the schedule 
the final report is prepared.
• Audit will happen to confirm the task and payment 
are completed as per schedule.
• Final Kick off meeting will be happen based on the
